abstract: Most digital electronic circuits utilize a timing reference to synchronize
  the progression of signals and enable sequential memory elements. These designs
  may not be realizable in biological substrates due to the lack of a reliable high-frequency
  clock signal. Asynchronous designs eliminate the need for a clock with data encodings
  and request/acknowledge handshake protocols. This paper proposes a workflow to automate
  the design of asynchronous genetic circuits. This workflow extends genetic design
  tools by leveraging asynchronous logic design methods customized for this technology.
  This workflow is demonstrated on a genetic sensor that uses filtering and cellular
  communication to improve its reliability.
